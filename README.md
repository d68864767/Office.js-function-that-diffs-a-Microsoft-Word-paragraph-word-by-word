# Word Paragraph Update

This project contains a JavaScript function that makes targeted updates to a Microsoft Word paragraph to match revised paragraph text. The function is designed to only edit those words and characters in the Microsoft Word paragraph that are necessary to match the revised paragraph text. This is particularly useful when "track changes" is turned on, as only those words appear as changed.
